logic regression

It's the question 20 from machine learning course https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw3/hw3.pdf

Implement the fixed learning rate stochastic gradient descent algorithm below for logistic regression,
initialized with 0. Instead of randomly choosing n in each iteration, please simply pick
the example with the cyclic order n = 1, 2, . . . , N, 1, 2, . . .. Run the algorithm with Î· = 0.001 and
T = 2000 on the following set for training:

and the following set for testing:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw3/hw3_test.dat
What is the weight vector within your g? What is the Eout(g) from your algorithm, evaluated using
the 0/1 error on the test set?
